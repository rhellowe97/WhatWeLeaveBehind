# What We Leave Behind

What We Leave Behind is a 2.5D Puzzle Platformer prototype meant to ignite the players creativity when interacting with it's unique physics mechanics. Progressing in a linear fashion, the game contains a variety of ways that the player robot can use it's magnetic devices to reach the end of each level.

Areas of focus for this project:
- Creating a Save Data system so that player progression through various biomes and their contained levels can be tracked.
- Creating a dialogue system so that the main character can narrarate their discoveries with colour-coded keywords.
- Developing creative physics interactions for the puzzles that the player encounters, and using their magnet tool to overcome them.
- Integrating pooled audio sources and fx into the object pooling system beyond other physical gameplay elements.
